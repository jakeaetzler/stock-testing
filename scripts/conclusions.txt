CSCI349 Conclusions:

As can be seen in the reported precisions above, our Random Forest Classifier is able to successfully decide if a stock
will increase or decrease over 50% of the time for $PNM, $GALT, and $AMZN. Surprisingly, we achieved our highest precision
score with $AMZN at around 0.54. In our performance results we found the reason for the error in predictability is because
of the number of false positives, which is relatively high, for each of the stock tickers that we modeled.

With the current performance metrics our model is producing, we cannot recommend purely buying and selling stock based
off the model's predictions. What we can safely say is that our model has proven itself to be a valid tool in evaluating
likely potential movement of the stock. One very good use for our model would be if it were used in a suite of metrics
for determining stock movement. Our previous work with the Prophet model has proven that it also has validity in
determining stock movement, and potentially utilizing these 2 models together could lead to higher precision scores for
our predictions.
